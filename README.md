# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is an Express.js app with a simple front-end, where you take a short quiz to be matched with a previous quiz-taker. The matching is based on survey answers given.

## Organization

The app runs on Node.js, with a basic HTML front-end. Data is stored in-memory (and not persisted to a datastore).

Data is transferred to and from the application via a single API endpoint, which accepts both `GET` and `POST` requests.

## Accessing the App

Friend Finder is currently deployed to Heroku.
